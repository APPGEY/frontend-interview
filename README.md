# Front End Test for Serempre
Hi! 👋 We are glad that you have reached this point and can become part of the great team of Serempre.

### What should you do? 🧩

Your task is to take the following design and develop it in JS Vanilla, React, Angular or Vue.

In the following repository you will find the necessary sources to carry out the task.

### What are we searching for? 🕵️‍♂️

- **Attention to detail**. The development must be faithful to the design completely. Taking into account colors, typographic scale, spacing, line height, etc.
- **Take into account the different devices**. In the design, you can find the respective references to the breakpoints.
- **Make it interactive**. Users will be able to select between the different images and see the preview in real-time, they will also be able to explore the different characteristics (Overview, features, etc.) of the product through some tabs, and the total price must show the configuration selected by the user in the total located in the footer.
- **Make your solution accessible**. Follow the best accessibility standards, including keyboard navigation.
- **Create your components from scratch**. Don't use any library for the image carousel, tabs, etc.
- **Create reusable and scalable components**. Think about the number of developers that could participate in the project as well as how much it could grow.
